## Challenges

## Future Iterations

### Comments

- In a future iteration, we would like to implement commenting functionality. For example, a user should be able to navigate to a single movie show page and view all comments available for the movie. If the user is logged in, they should also be able to utilize a form to add their own comment.

### Favorites and Filtering

- Additionally, we would like users to be able to favorite movies and filter the view so they see only their favorite movies. The ability to do this would be based on their login status.
